## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use a self-hosted (local) font. I'd normally use Google fonts but I decided to try using the font in the `fonts` folder.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/static/Figtree-Medium.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 500;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/static/Figtree-ExtraBold.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 800;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Self-Hosting Web Font Files](https://medium.com/going-fullstack/self-hosting-web-font-files-6a46bfc36ffd) - This helped me to use a self-hosted font in the project.
